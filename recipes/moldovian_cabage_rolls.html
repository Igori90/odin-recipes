   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>My recipe for traditional <strong>Cabbage Rolls (Sarmale)</strong> are made with sour cabbage stuffed with pork,
      beef, and little bit of bacon. They’re the best cabbage rolls you will ever have! </p>
   <p>This recipe for Romanian cabbage rolls is tried and true. I’ve made it probably a hundred times, and have rolled
      thousands of them! The big difference between Romanian cabbage rolls and others are that we make them with
      <strong>sour cabbage</strong>
      . You can find sour cabbage at pretty much all grocery stores sold in jars. You can also find sour cabbage
      at your local Polish or Ukrainian stores!
   </p>
   <p>This is my mom’s recipe and it’s my favorite. I won’t eat cabbage rolls made any other way. The other piece that
      separates Romanian cabbage rolls from the rest is that we add some kind of smoked meat. This time I used
      <strong>smoked bacon </strong>
      . Now I’ve got your attention, hey?
   </p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <p>I know some people avoid making their own cabbage rolls because they assume this type of recipe is complicated.
      Just look at these ingredients! They’re really simple.
   </p>
   <p>For this recipe you’ll need:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong><em>Vegetable oil</em></strong>– We’ll be using this to saute the onion and rice. You can use any type
         of oil that you have handy.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Onion</em></strong>– I used a large onion because this recipe makes a lot of cabbage rolls. Every
         bite should have onion in it!</li>
      <li><strong><em>Long grain rice</em></strong>– Basmati rice is best. I wouldn’t use brown rice- it takes a lot
         longer to cook than white rice and you may end up with crunchy bits in your rolls.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Ground pork</em></strong> – I love to use pork because it has a higher fat content and makes for
         some nice juicy rolls. You can use any type of ground meat you like, but keep in mind that leaner meats like
         chicken or turkey will come out drier.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Fresh parsley & dill</em></strong> – Fresh parsley & dill – Using fresh herbs makes such a big
         difference in how the flavor develops in your rolls!</li>
      <li><strong><em>Salt & pepper</em></strong> – Season the mixture to your own discretion.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Sour cabbage leaves</em></strong> – This is what really sets the Romanian version apart from the
         rest. The little hit of vinegar is to die for!</li>
      <li><strong><em>Bacon</em></strong> – Find yourself a nice thick-cut smoky style of bacon.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Tomato juice</em></strong> – This is what our rolls are going to sit and cook in.</li>

   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <p>This recipe is super easy to prepare. The hardest part is getting through rolling all of that filling, but I
      promise it’s worth it. Make a day of it and invite some friends and family to help!</p>
   <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare the filling: </strong>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high. Saute the onions until
         translucent,
         then add the rice and toast for 1 minute. Add the pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill, and the onion mixture
         to a large bowl and mix well. Use salt sparingly – the cabbage leaves are brined.</li>
      <li><strong>Roll the filling: </strong>Remove the cabbage leaves from the brine. You can soak them in water
         beforehand to
         draw out some of the salt. Cut each leaf in half and fill the piece with a few tbsp of the meat mixture and
         roll. Refer to the video in the recipe card to see how I roll these nice and tight. Repeat until all the
         filling has been used.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble the rolls: </strong> Chop up the remaining cabbage leaves and add them to a large pot or deep
         roasting
         dish with a lid. Arrange all the rolls over the chopped cabbage and disperse the bacon evenly among the
         rolls. Pour the tomato juice over the rolls and top up with some water, if needed, to ensure the rolls are
         covered with liquid.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake the rolls: </strong>Cover the pot with a lid or foil. Bake at 375F for 2 hours, then remove the
         cover and
         cook for another 1 1/2 – 2 hours. Serve hot with a side of sour cream. </li>
   </ol>
