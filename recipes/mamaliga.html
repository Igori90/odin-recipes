   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Similar to polenta, Romanian cornmeal porridge, or mamaliga, is an ancient dish that began as peasant food and is
      now served at fine restaurants. It is a simple combination of cornmeal, water (or stock or milk), salt, and
      butter, and can be served with sour cream, fresh cheese, and herbs. </p>
   <p>This is a basic soft mamaliga recipe, but the porridge can also be baked or fried. No matter how you prepare it,
      the mixture does need to be stirred frequently as it cooks for about 40 minutes on the stovetop. This recipe
      suggests topping the mamaliga with telemea, a traditional Romanian cheese made from sheep's milk that is
      semi-soft, crumbly, and a bit salty, similar to feta cheese. </p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>

   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>

         pot, about 35 to 40 minutes. </li>
