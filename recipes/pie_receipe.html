   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>When Nicolina and I got married I wanted to cook her the foods that she grew up with. This Moldovan Cheese Pie is a
      savory reminder of her childhood. My mother in law Natasha told me how to make the filling and I watched youtube
      videos in Russian to learn how to make it. I don’t understand Russian so there was some guess work involved but
      the final result was perfect. If you love cheese and dill you will love this pie. I try not to make it too often
      because it’s hard to stop myself from eating the whole thing. </p>

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   

   <ul>
      <li>For the dough:
         <ul>
            <li>4 cups of flour</li>
            <li> 1¼ cups of water</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li> ½ cup of vegetable oil plus more when rolling out dough
            </li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For the filling:
         <ul>
            <li>  2 cups chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>1 cup crumbled feta</li>
            <li>1 lb farmer's cheese ( you can substitute queso blanco)</li>

      </li>
   </ul>


   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Mix all the flour ingredients together and kneed until it forms a cohesive ball. If you need add more flour or
         water if dough is too dry or sticky do so 1 tablespoon at a time </li>

      <li> Add ⅓ of the filling - see pictures above and roll into a log</li>
      <li>Roll log into spiral</li>
      <li>Repeat with remaining dough</li>
      <li>Brush dough with egg ( optional )</li>
